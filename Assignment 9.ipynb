    "str: The str type represents a Unicode string in Python. It is the default string type in Python 3.x. The str type is versatile and allows you to work with text in various encodings and languages. It provides a wide range of methods for manipulating and formatting strings, such as upper(), lower(), split(), join(), and many more. Strings of type str are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created.\n",

    "Answer-- Unicode represents most written languages in the world. ASCII has its equivalent in Unicode. The difference between ASCII and Unicode is that ASCII represents lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0–9) and symbols such as punctuation marks while Unicode represents letters of English, Arabic, Greek etc. mathematical symbols, historical scripts, emoji covering a wide range of characters than ASCII."

    "Answer-- Python 3 stores strings as Unicode by default whereas Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode. Unicode strings are more versatile than ASCII strings, which are the Python 3.X default, as they can store letters from foreign languages as well as emoji and the standard Roman letters and numerals."
