    "\n",
    "Answer--Shallow Copy: Shallow repetition is quicker. However, it’s “lazy” it handles pointers and references. Rather than creating a contemporary copy of the particular knowledge the pointer points to, it simply copies over the pointer price. So, each of the first and therefore the copy can have pointers that reference constant underlying knowledge.\n",
