    "# Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--It's important to note that importing the same module multiple times doesn't result in multiple copies of the module being loaded into memory. Python's import system ensures that the module is only loaded once, and subsequent import statements simply reference the already loaded module.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using multiple import statements for the same module can have specific use cases, it's generally advisable to keep imports concise, clear, and avoid unnecessary redundancy to maintain code readability and prevent confusion.\n",

    "# Q2. What are some of a module's characteristics? (Name at least one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--One characteristic of a module in Python is that it serves as a self-contained unit that encapsulates related code, data, or functionality. Modules allow you to organize and structure your code by grouping related components together. They provide a way to logically separate different parts of your program and promote code reusability and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can also provide namespaces, allowing you to avoid naming conflicts between components with similar names defined in different modules. By importing specific modules or components, you can selectively access and utilize the functionality provided by the module without cluttering the global namespace."

    "\n",
    "Answer--If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. "

    "# Q6. What are some of the benefits of attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-- Attaching a program counter to an RPN interpreter provides control over the execution flow, enables conditional execution and looping, aids in error handling and debugging, and helps maintain program state and context. These benefits contribute to more powerful, flexible, and robust interpretation of RPN scripts."
