    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer--Delegation is a design pattern and a concept in object-oriented programming where an object forwards or delegates a specific task or responsibility to another object. Instead of implementing the behavior directly, the delegating object relies on another object to perform the task on its behalf."

    "\n",
    "Answer--In the concept of Composition, a class refers to one or more other classes by using instances of those classes as a instance variable. irrespective of inheritence in this approach all the parent class members are not inherited into child class, but only required methods from a class are used by using class instances."

    "\n",
    "Answer--In Python, a bound method refers to a method that is associated with a specific instance of a class. When a method is called on an instance, it becomes a bound method, where the instance itself is implicitly passed as the first argument (commonly referred to as self)."

    "Answer--The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to signal to other developers that an attribute is intended for internal use within the class and should not be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. It serves as a form of information hiding and encapsulation, promoting encapsulation of implementation details."
